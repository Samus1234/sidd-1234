## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Siddharth Gangadhar! I'm a graduate Computer Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University.

Check out these simulations and ROS projects pertaining to my graduate research work:

* [occlusion-and-interaction-aware-safe-control] [https://github.com/sidd-1234/occlusion-and-interaction-aware-safe-control]
* [occlusion-and-interaction-aware-safe-control-ROS] [https://github.com/sidd-1234/occlusion-and-interaction-aware-safe-control-ROS]
* [anytime-autonomy-ROS] [https://github.com/mlab-upenn/anytime-stack]
* [iv-2022-safe-control-simulation] [https://github.com/sidd-1234/iv-2022-safe-control-simulation]
* [ekf-model-identification] [https://github.com/sidd-1234/ekf-model-identification]
* [18-776-model-adaptive-drone-control] [[https://github.com/sidd-1234/18-776-model-adaptive-drone-control]

And this is for a machine learning course project on using Eigen and CUDA for deep learning applications in C++

* [cpp-torch-from-scratch] [https://github.com/sidd-1234/cpp-torch-from-scratch]
